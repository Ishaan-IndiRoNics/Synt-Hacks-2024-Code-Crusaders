Ahan, I need 10 more questions of Maths. 2 of each level.
Give in format -> ["question", "answer in lowercase", 0, difficulty]
difficulty as a number from 0 to 4 ends inclusive.
Also give 5 similarly (one of each level) for science.



Maths-
1. 35x=70  --> ans = 2 --> 0 --> difficulty --> easy
2. 34x=102 --> ans = 3 --> 0 --> difficulty -->easy
3. 107*7   --> ans=749 --> 0 --> difficulty -->medium
4. 142*9   --> ans=1278 --> 0 --> difficulty --> medium
5. (x+4-18)/6 =6 --> ans=50 --> 0 --> difficulty --> medium hard
6. (x+9-24)/8 =2 --> ans=31 --> 0 --> difficulty --> medium hard
7. Max works in the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant.
