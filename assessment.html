			<p>	EduBot is an <i>easy-to-access child-friendly</i> web service. Our aim at EduBot is to help young children to asses there strengths and weaknesses, so that they can work on them and <i>excel in academics</i>.</p>

			<p>	Children can answer our assesment questions and review our analysis. There are three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. Based on the results of the assesment and difficulty level of the questions, we generate feedback.</p>

			<p>	We built EduBot as a tool for students, and we hope that it is fruitful in development of many students.</p>
